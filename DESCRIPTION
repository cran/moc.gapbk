Description: Implements the Multi-Objective Clustering Algorithm Guided by a-Priori Biological Knowledge (MOC-GaPBK) which was proposed by Parraga-Alava, J. et. al. (2018) <doi:10.1186/s13040-018-0178-4>. It was designed for clustering genes based on co-expression, biological coherence, compactness, and separation criteria. However, its flexible design allows it to be applied to cluster data of various types and domains. The algorithm optimizes object relationships based on two objective functions using cluster quality indexes, incorporating intensification and diversification strategies to enhance the search process.
